        <h1> My 2020 Wishlist! </h1>
        <p> Happy Holidays everyone! In celebration of the holidays, I dedicated this project to my Christmas 'Wishlist', or just what I'd ask for in general. It took me a while to decide how I would organize this, but I eventually got it all down! </p>
        <h2> Clothes/Accessories </h2>
     <div class="row">
  <div class="column">

          <p> For this portion of my Wishlist, I wanted to discover my style more, and explore different types of clothes rather than the hoodie and jeans that I always wear! So for Christmas, I hope to invest in cargo pants with matching tops to go with it, following the butterfly accessories that I also included. To find clothes like the ones I have above, you can visit <a href="https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=L&ai=DChcSEwjQn9eMsuLtAhXBuIYKHXWzB-YYABAAGgJ2dQ&ae=2&sig=AOD64_3GCTINR-wrEi60oxS-hCj6gL3lhQ&q&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwjY1s2MsuLtAhXjuFkKHUlKCiAQ0Qx6BAgZEAE">Shein</a>, where the clothes come cheaper but good quality! </p>
        
        <h2> Gaming </h2>
        <ul> <li> <strong> Hp Laptop </strong> </li> </ul>
        <p> Since I'm getting into gaming more, I wanted to start off with a simple laptop, which would be the HP Laptop model. Found on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HP-i7-1165G7-Processor-Micro-Edge-15-eg0021nr/dp/B08KGYDR16/ref=sr_1_4?crid=1AXZ71VWYC1EV&dchild=1&keywords=hp+laptop&qid=1608846380&sprefix=hp+%2Caps%2C181&sr=8-4#customerReviews">Amazon</a>, I hope to order this for Christmas! </p>
        
        <ul> <li> <strong> Games I hope to play </strong> </li> </ul> 
        <p> I've been looking into Games to play on my laptop, so I chose: Valorant, Apex, Overwatch, Minecraft, Rogue Company, and Call of Duty. Ive already played most of these but switching over to PC may make the gameplay alot more different! </p>
        
        <h2> <marquee> The most imporant gift of all </marquee> </h2>
        <p> The gift of spending time with my family! I really enjoyed working on this project, It was super fun to explore new codes and etc ! </p>
